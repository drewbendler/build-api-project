# Emissions vs Climate vs Glaciers API

    - Full CRUD API about emissions and climate

## Getting Started

    - This API displays information about the fossil fuel emissions from every country since 1998 to 2014 and the average surface temp for that year.
    - I decided to pair the average glacier mass to really put in perspective the impact our civilization have on our planet.

## Installation

    - npm
    - express
    - mongoose
